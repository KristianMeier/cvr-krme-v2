# Production Site

`https://cvr-krme.netlify.app/`

# Project Scope

`I built some of the pages/features from a site i use everyday in accounting: https://businessindenmark.virk.dk. This is done so I could pratice / prepare for the internship 01/01-2023.`

# Choice of Architecture

`I have used node-sass with flexbox for the styling. This is done to mirror the technology choice in the project I will work on. As a "backend", I have used Local Storage. For the content on the website, I have used one .js file with one object. The choice of backend is made to save time, as I barely had time to learn intership-level React and CSS before the internship start date`

# To-do

`Learn to use :after, :before and classOne.classTwo. The https://billy.dk codebase uses it a lot.`
`Increase efficiency: Use these more in VS Code: Command+P and Control+Tab. Customize the RAFCE snippit and learn 1 VS Code and Emmet trick every day`
