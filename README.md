# Project Scope

`I built some of the pages/features from a site i use everyday in accounting: businessindenmark.virk.dk. This is done so I could pratice / prepare for the internship 01/01-2023. I been told, that the tasks in the internship will be 60% CSS and 40% React.`

# Choice of Architecture

`I could have built the project only using useState and useEffect, but I have used other hooks also, just for practice. I have used node-sass with flexbox for the styling. This is done since they are used in the project i will work on. As a "backend", I have used localStorage. For the content on the website, I have used one .js file with one object. The choice of backend is made to save time, as barely had time to learn intership-level React and CSS before the internship start date`

# To-do

`Learn to use :after, :before and classOne.classTwo like billy.dk-codebase does a lot.`
`Increase efficiency: Use these more in VS Code instead of mousepad: Command+P, Control+Tab, Command+W.`
`Make custom React snippits and look up VS Code and Emmet stuff, to improve efficiency.`
